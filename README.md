autocoder
=========
Small tool to extract Unreal Scripts keywords & specifiers  and generate corresponding cpp codes.
Designed to assist in the development of an IDE for Unreal Script.

But it turned out to be much more difficult than I've expected to support intellisense using Qt's TextEdit.

The repo is currently pended. Maybe I can turn to Scintilla to continue this, when I have time.
